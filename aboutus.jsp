        <p class="style10"><strong>In today's competitive  environment where everybody wants to be on the top, Information plays very  crucial role. As fast as information is accessed and processed, it can give  good results .Today Internet is the fast way of transferring Data and  Information over wide area ,hence I have used internet as a way for exchanging  information.<br>

          This project is a business to  Consumer, E-Commerce web site. There is difference between our site and a  portal .Example&nbsp; of Portal is like Yahoo,  Rediff and Indiatimes where as examples of Web &ndash;site is like bazee, delhihotels  ,jobs ahead etc. Portal is general in nature and has many objectives to  accomplish where as Web-site is specific in nature and has only one objective  to accomplish hence our project is a website and not a portal .<br>
